<p>Ganesh Tok is a small temple and a loved viewpoint in Gangtok. Situated on top of a hill, the quaint place has mind-stirring views - the Kanchenjunga hill can be seen in its true form of glory from here and is at its best especially in the morning. The Ganesh Tok viewpoint, situated at a distance of 6500, offers stunning views of the mountains dusted with snow. The temple (dedicated to Lord Ganesh) is, however, so small that it can only fit one person at a time.
